# Headgear
we deserve better sight

the headgear is the best way of communicating information to the user, visually.

## sight
using the IR-cut cameras makes it so we can see in the dark and don't have to give our location away by using lights that are in the human visible spectrum.

## information
we can also use the display to readout data from sensors elsewhere in the kit
