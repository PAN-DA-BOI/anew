# anew

I will be born anew. This project is a compromise. Yes, it's a little silly, but I've been repeatedly told I'm explicitly *not* allowed to remove parts of my body just to replace them with metal. In this light, I (and my smartest/best friends) are making gadgets to help me become the cyborg I was truly meant to be.

## getting started

start by getting and sorting the project! first, git the project and then follow the instructions for each part your building! Each "part" of the project is sorted into how many PIs your willing to use, were tring to cut down on as many as possible. But bare minimum the arm and headgear need a pi each. 

```
git clone https://github.com/PAN-DA-BOI/anew.git
```

## Headgear
run the commands below to set a pi up for the headgear

```
chmod +x ./anew/headgear/headgear.sh
./anew/headgear/headgear.sh
```

read more about the [headgear](https://github.com/PAN-DA-BOI/anew/blob/development/headgear/headgear.md) here.

## Arm
run the commands below to set the pi up as the arm kit

```
chmod +x ./anew/arm/arm.sh
./anew/arm/arm.sh
```
